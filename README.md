Monster Hunter has an unique skill system, and in order to active a certain skill, we need to craft a combination of armors including a weapon, a helmet, a body armor, a waist armor, an arm armor, a legs armor and an amulet, whose total contribution to the desired skill exceeds a skill points level. Finding the right set of armor pieces that activates the required skills is difficult, as there are ~ 150 different skill trees, ~ 600 candidate armors for each of the pieces, and each armor contributes to several skills, positively or negatively. What makes the problem more interesting is that armors may have slots, where different decorations contributing to different skills can be plugged in.
